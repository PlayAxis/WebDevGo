The project was supposed to be based on the game Go, but upon further research, the team
discovered that Go was a different game, and the game we were thinking of is actually called
Othello. The team decided to go with Othello instead of Go.

The game requires a board and pieces to be drawn, which was done by an HTML Canvas using basic
paths and path checking to place down pieces. The difficult part was then checking which pieces
to flip as there are 8 directions in which pieces could theoretically be flipped, thus a function
was necessary for each direction to check for pieces to flip. Another difficulty was finding valid
spots for places to be put down as a player can only place pieces in a spot that will flip an opposing
piece. Overall, the project required a lot of JavaScript logic to get working correctly and usage
of HTML Canvas to fully come together, and was good practice in both fields.

Roughly, this project took about as much time and effort as the other projects in the class for each
team member, thus, it should be deserving of 100 points as it is comparable to previous assignments
in effort and time.
